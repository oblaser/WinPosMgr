Moves and resizes windows on your MS Windows desktop environment.

This is actually a workaround for some annoying behaviour of a Windows machine within a multi screen setup and a KVM switch with only one video port.

## Command line arguments

| arg | Description |
|---|---|
| none | enters the mode specified in the settings |
| `gui` | enters to an interactive GUI |
| `run` | just processes the jobs (hidden mode) |

## Reset

To restore the "factory defaults" delete `settings.ini`, `config.ini` and optionally `jobs.ini`
